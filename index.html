          <h2>What is Experimonth?</h2>
          <p>Experimonth started in January of 2009 as a way to redefine New Year's Resolutions and served
            that role for two years. The first experimonths were:

          </ul>
          </p>
            
            <p>In April of 2011, it was brought to the <a href="http://lifeandscience.org">Museum of Life 
              and Science</a> as a way to co-create a fun experience with a local researchers. The experiment 
            went well and it's became a model for <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/citscitoolkit/about/defining-citizen-science/">public 
            participation in scientific research</a>. The first science-related experimonths were:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Experimonth: Mood</strong> (April 2011) texted participants five times a day, every day for 
              one month, asking the same question each time: "Rate your mood 1 (low) to 10 (high)." Participants 
              texted back this data, which was visualized on a website in context of the entire community of 
              participants. The website also hosted a blog where participants could read about mood and positive 
              emotion. This Experimonth was co-developed by Frances Ulman, Ph.D. (social scientist), Science Museum 
              of Minnesota, and Michigan State University.</li>

            <li><strong>Experimonth: Race</strong> (November 2011) was a companion experience to the Race: Are We So 
              Different traveling exhibition. Participants explored issues of race and ethnicity 
              through discussions on Facebook groups. Each group was assigned a different activity 
              or topic (e.g. Baby Doll experiment, Best of Enemies book club, Cultural Plunge, News 
              Watchdog, Personal Timeline Project, Shutterbug, "Smart, Hot, Honest or Not?", "30 Days, 
              30 Questions", and Confessional) and a museum educator facilitated discussion over the 
              course of the month. In addition to the Facebook groups, there was also an implicit 
              association game "Smart, Hot, Honest or Not?" that used facial morphing software to change 
              the perceived ethnicity of players’ headshots and asked them to vote on how attractive, 
              intelligent and trustworthy someone was in comparison to some other player (at random). 
              This gave players who uploaded their photo a view into how they are perceived as their 
              own ethnicity and as another. This Experimonth was co-developed with the Science Museum of 
              Minnesota (who ran a companion Experimonth called "Experimonth: Identity" also in November 2011), 
              Michigan State University, and April Harris-Britt, Ph.D. (social scientist).</li>
        </ul></p>

          <p>In September of 2011, the <a href="http://nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a> funded four 
            additional Experimonths through the project "Science of Sharing," a partnership between MLS and 
            the <a href="http://exploratorium.edu">Exploratorium</a> in San Francisco, CA. This support 
            brought several MLS/Exploratorium prototypes and final projects:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Frenemy</strong> (June 2012, February 2014) paired each player with a stranger 
                every morning for one month (a different one each day). Equipped with only one piece of 
                information about each other and no way to communicate with each other, players decided 
                whether to be friends or enemies, but at a price (friend/friend = 15 points each, 
                friend/enemy = -5 to friend-er, +25 to enemy-er, enemy/enemy = 5, 5).</li>
              <li><strong>Do You Know What I Know You Know?</strong> (April 2014) paired each player with 
                a stranger or two strangers (a different one each day) and asked a series of opinion-based 
                questions. Without the ability to communicate with one another, the players needed to come 
                to a consensus around an answer before proceeding.</li>
              <li><strong>Freeloader</strong> (July 2014) randomly grouped players in teams on the first day 
                and gave each player the choice whether or not to stay with the team as the month progressed.  
                Each day, players were given one dollar and asked whether or not they wanted to invest in the 
                group or freeload off the folks who decide to invest. </li>
              <li><strong>Belonging</strong> (September 2014) attempted to visualize and map people’s feelings 
                about belonging in various places across the world by installing a poster that asked passersby 
                to mark or text whether or not they felt they belonged in a specific location. In addition to 
                the mapping component, participants were asked to confess moments where they felt in or out 
                in social situations. Many of these confessions were blogged on the Belonging website. 
                Participants also took and shared a Spectrum Survey that used Likert scales instead of 
                categories or binaries to collect information about identity.</li> </ul></p>
          <p>In addition to the Experimonths listed above, there were two beta Experimonths prototyped for 
            Science of Sharing: 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trade It Up</strong> (April 2012) gave each participant a small pin and asked them to 
              trade it for items of greater value over the course of the month.</li>
            <li><strong>PassWord</strong> (July 2012) split participants into 12-person teams that virtually 
              raced each other across the country on a Google Map, using shared mileage inspired by the economics 
              theory called Tragedy of the Commons.</li>
    </ul></p>

          <p>And there have been the following Experimonth experiments: Experimonth: Eh? (August 2012), 
            Experimonth: Jane Goodall (June 2014), and Experimonth: Strike-a-match (February 2013).</p>
          
          <p>At their heart, experimonths are month-long, participatory blogging projects that 
            anyone can do. Feel free to experiment with experimonths in your own life and organization.</p>
